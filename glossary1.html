                <h1>Repository</h1>
                <p class="glossary">A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.</p>

                <h1>Branch</h1>
                <p class="glossary">A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master. This is the official working version of your project, and the one you see when you visit the project repository at github.com/yourname/projectname.</p>

                <h1>Clone</h1>
                <p class="glossary">When you create a repository on GitHub.com, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.</p>
                
                <h1>Commit</h1>
                <p class="glossary"> A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set
                of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a
                unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep
                record of the specific changes committed along with who made them
                and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief
                description of what changes were made.</p>

                <h1>Push</h1>
                <p class="glossary">To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository
                on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you
                can push those changes so that others may access them.</p>

                <h1>Pull</h1>
                <p class="glossary">Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.
                For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both
                working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy
                so that it's up to date. See also fetch.</p>

                <h1>Merge</h1>
                <p class="glossary">Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or
                from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a
                "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or
                can always be done via the command line.</p>
